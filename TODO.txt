(A) Feature Extraction and Statistics (AfterImage, netStat)
    - extract features based on HTTP headers - web-based IDS
    - extract features related to the payload (XML file)
    - final feature selection with PCA or heatmap?
    - currently packet flows (streams) between two devices get measured based on srcIP and dstIP  
        -> in case of sdc data it might be better to measure streams based on Session ID
(B) Data Generator 
    - automate generation of different anomalies to evaluate the model (i.e. like ID2T)
    - add noise to generate more realistic datasets 
    - data augmentation 
(C) online packet capturing (Kitsune)
    - improve parsing speed with cython, numba jit or multiprocessing
(D) Framework to test it on IoT devices (with Raspberry Pi or Nvidia Jetson Nano)
    - generate dataset with man-in-the-middle attack (tool to do so: ettercap)
(E) Evaluation 
    - visualize clustering to manually optimize the feature map 
    - Explainable AI to visualize the reason for raising alarms 
        - e.g. use logged packets that cause an alarm to visualize the attacker on network graph in neo4j browser
